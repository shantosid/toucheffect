# toucheffect

I as usual was passing through my boring days. Half of my phones display doesn't work and I don't want to replace it too! Sometimes,
something happens and it starts touching automatically! So as a part of lifelessproduction, I developed it in react native
to just count clicks!

Peace! <3
